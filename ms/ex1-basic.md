Welcome to your new foam workspace, let\'s get you started.
===========================================================

> if you are already familiar with Foam and don\'t need help, just
> remove the \`docs\` folder for a clean repo.

Let\'s go through this to set up your repo:

-   if you are new with VS Code, see how to get-started-with-vscode

-   you can navigate the links between your notes by \`cmd+click\` (or
    \`ctrl+click\` on Windows) on a wikilink. You can go back with
    \`ctrl+-\`. Here, go to your \[\[inbox\]\]

1.  to see how your notes are connected, execute the \`Foam: Show
    Graph\` command. See \[\[graph-visualization\]\].

2.  \#tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the
    \`Tag Explorer\` view on the left panel to find and navigate the
    tags in your knowledge base. See \[\[tags-and-tag-explorer\]\].

Foam supports *spell-checking* via VS Code.

Living within VS Code, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the
[Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/recipes/recipes)
for ideas!

Advanced Features
-----------------

You can create note-templates for things like book reviews, people,
daily notes (coming soon), and more!

About Foam
----------

Foam doesn\'t do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing
extensions. Look at their documentation if you want to fully unlock the
possibilities!
